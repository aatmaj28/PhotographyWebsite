## 📷 About This Portfolio

Welcome to my digital photography showcase! This website serves as a comprehensive gallery of my photographic work, capturing moments and creating art through my lens. As a 22-year-old photographer and student at Northeastern University, Boston, I've developed this portfolio to:

- **Showcase my artistic vision** through a curated collection of 50+ photographs
- **Document my journey** in photography, from capturing everyday moments to creating compelling visual narratives
- **Connect with viewers** who appreciate the art of photography and storytelling through images

This portfolio represents my passion for photography, where each image tells a unique story. Whether it's capturing the vibrant energy of Boston's urban landscape, the subtle beauty in everyday moments, or experimental artistic compositions, my work aims to evoke emotions and create lasting impressions.

The website features a clean, modern design that puts the focus on the photographs themselves, with smooth interactions and an immersive viewing experience that allows visitors to fully appreciate each image in my collection.
